# Frequently Asked Questions

## Are there travel funds available?

Unfortunately, we were unable to secure travel funds for this event. 

## Will there be food provided?

Since we don't have funding and this is a free event, we are unable to provide snacks and refreshments but there is a cafe onsite. For information on what is offered in NCAR's Mesa Lab cafe and a site map, visit the [NCAR "things to know" page](https://scied.ucar.edu/visit/things-to-know).

## Can I participate remotely?

Yes! Our meeting rooms will be equipped for hybrid events. We will have at least two synchronous plenary sessions each day so remote participants will be able to present work to the whole group.

## Is there a reserved hotel block for this event?

Yes! We requested 20 rooms at the Fairfield Inn & Suites in Boulder, CO. More information on how to reserve to come.

## I don't know anything about how to build a Cookbook, should I attend?

Yes! The Pythia team will provide tutorials and guidance on using our GitHub-based infrastructure. Bring your science.
